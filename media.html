   <h1>Using media represntations to tell a short story about my natural hair</h1>

   <p>Maintaining an Afro can be challenging, but itâ€™s manageable with the right knowledge, tools, and routine. The
      difficulty level often depends on factors like hair texture, length, personal lifestyle, and familiarity with Afro
      hair care practices. Taking care of an African hair type, particularly an Afro, requires a specialized routine
      that focuses on maintaining moisture, preventing breakage, and promoting healthy growth. <br>The following images
      depicts my hair in different stages. </p>
