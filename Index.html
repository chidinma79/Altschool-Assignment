        <p>My name is Joy Chidinma Ochuba, my student ID IS ALT/SOE/024/0024. I studied computer science in my first degree
          (Bsc) from Abia State University. I also studied Information Technology in my second degree (MIT) from University
          of Lagos.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating, I started my carrer as an intern in a software company named SystemtechGroup which is a small
          start up in Lagos Nigeria. My role involved cloning monitor for meduim and large organisations and also
          troubleshooting software issues. I have a strong problem solving skills and my dedicatio quickly earned me a
          reputation as a relaible and inovative team member.</p>
        <p><strong>Proffesional Growth:</strong></p>
        <p>In 2019, I joined a leading IT firm as a technical support engineer, here I was responsible for IT systems,
          identifying areas for improvement, and implemenying solutions to enhance efficiency and optimize workflow. My
          ability to understand complex systems ad develop effective solutions helped me rise as I moved on to higher carrer
          paths.</p>
        <p>I am a tech enthusiast who enjoys solving complex problem and finding innovative solutions using technlogy. This
          mindset drives me to continously learn and improve my technical skills.</p>
        <p>Joining ALTSchool of engineering is a significant step towards my sucessdul carrer in the tech industry. This
          will provide me with a solid foundation in both theoretical ad practical aspects of software engineering, where I
          can engage in various projects that simulate real world scenarios, providing practicL nd theorectical experiences.
          I have always looked forward to learning from experienced instructors and industry proffessionals who provide
          mentorship and guidance. I believe I could also find opportunities t connect with alumni and proffesionals in the
          field, which can be invaluable to my carrer growth.</p>
